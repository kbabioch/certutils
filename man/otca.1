.SH DESCRIPTION
.B otca 
is a script for setting up a public-key infrastructure (PKI), which is built
around a certificate authority (CA) that is only used once. After all of the
certificates have been signed, the CA's private key is permanently removed
and no other actions can be taken.

This is useful in instances where the scaling benefits of a PKI are actually
not needed, but using certificates is still desired. One particular use case
is a point-to-point OpenVPN setup. While OpenVPN supports static keys, using
certificates provides additional security (ephemeral keys, forward secrecy).

Generating the keys and signing the appropriate certificates quickly becomes a
tedious task.
.B otca
tries to simplify this.

.SH NOTES
Since the private key of the CA is removed, no additional certificates can be
issued and/or revoked. If these aspects of a PKI are really needed,
.B otca 
is probably the wrong tool.
